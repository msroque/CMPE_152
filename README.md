# CMPE 152 - Complier Design
This is the final Project for the Complier Design class made in 2020. The project is a language called ***Michelle*** similar to C/C++.

### This language includes:
* Arithmetic Operations
* Assignment Statements
* Conditional and Looping Control Statements
* Print Statements / Variables
* Function Calls (pass by value)
* Function Declarations
* Function Returns

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/download.html)
* [Jasmin Assembler](http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/)

### Instructions
1. Create a new C++ project in Eclipse
2. Set up configurations to generate jasmin files (.j)
3. Set C++ dialect to C++ 11, the library should include antlr4-runtime in the C++ linker
4. Create the grammar file using antlr 4.8

5. Compile the program in Eclipse
   1. In run configurations, provide a name
   2. Add your sample code filename in the arguments under program arguments
6. Build and run the project in order to generate the jasmin code

## Running Tests
1. Go to the terminal, and change the directory to the jasmin folder
2. Build the class file

```console
java -jar jasmin.jar[YourJasminFileName + .j]
```

3. Execute the class file

```console
java -cp .:PascalRTL.jar [YourJasminFileName]
```

Here is an example using this project's sample.j file
